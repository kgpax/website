  Hello, I'm [Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevinpaxton82). After working in
  software engineering and web development for {timeWorkingInSoftware} years,
  I've come to the conclusion that it's time I had a website.
</InfoBlock>

In an attempt to get the creative juices flowing with what to put on this part of the cloud, I figured that I'd document the process of getting this site up and built to a level I'm happy with, which will be all its own challenge, but more on that later.

This will be a huge brain dump of the technical and creative thought process, and will arrive in stages alongside the general updates to the site.
