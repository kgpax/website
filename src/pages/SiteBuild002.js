        I was probably a little hasty in putting the site live. As soon as I had

        about my new venture, I decided to actually check for the first time how
        it looked on my phone.

        It wasn't good <E alt="grimacing face emoji">ðŸ˜¬</E>.

        There was zero padding around the content on mobile, making it
        particularly bad on any device with a{' '}
        <EL href="https://guide.servify.in/phone-notch-design-explained/">
          notch
        </EL>
        , and my attempt at vertically centering content on the homepage had
        backfired as the content itself was bigger than the viewport. For a
        front-end developer who claims to have an eye for design, this was all a
        bit of a misstep and a lesson learned about not getting carried away
        with the excitement of going live.

      <Paragraph>
        The next facepalm moment came when I realised after the fact that
        Netlify doesn't appreciate my 2014-era SPA, and would <C>404</C> if you
        tried to access a page directly. Makes sense, since all pages are
        currently routes rather than files, so I discovered that I needed to
        include a{' '}
        <EL href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/01/16/redirect-rules-for-all-how-to-configure-redirects-for-your-static-site/#the-redirects-file">
          special file
        </EL>{' '}
        to force all requests to go to the <C>index.html</C> page, and allow
        routing to handle all of the requests. It seems that putting a{' '}
        <C>_redirects</C> file in the root of the publication folder with the
        following content in does the trick:
      </Paragraph>
      <CodeBlock
        language="text"
        showLineNumbers={false}
        code={`/* /index.html 200`}
      />
      <Paragraph>
        ...however, this leaves a new problem dangling in that now all paths
        respond with a <C>HTTP 200</C> &mdash; even requests of invalid pages
        &mdash; which is still not what I want. However, it seems that if I want
        to have my pages and routes correct I've got to be a little more
        explicit in my
        <C>_redirects</C> file. This would be a pain to maintain, so I'm tempted
        to make it a part of the build process to generate this file based on
        the site navigation; alternatively I could bite the bullet earlier than
        expected and look to move to a static site generator for my content,
        doing away with the problem of virtual pages altogether.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Finally, I had noticed some things in the content of my{' '}
        <L href="/site-build-001">first post</L> which in hindsight I wasn't
        happy about. I'd used the phrase "I toyed with..." three separate times,
        which made me wish I had proof-read it sooner and been a bit more varied
        with my language. However, that made me decide to set myself a rule for
        this website: that I will not go back and change any posts I have
        published, except to correct any glaring typos or broken links. The
        content can stay with all its warts, hairs and careless grammar, and we
        will see if my copywriting improves over time.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        ...and yes, for those of you just noticing, I am quite self-critical. I
        don't beat myself up too much, it's just my way of trying to continually
        improve.

    <Segment heading="Back to the site">
      <Paragraph>
        Now that I've got a couple of pages of content, I wanted to allow
        navigation between them. For now, given that my site has just one story
        with multiple parts, I've gone down the route of a simple prev/next
        links at the end of each article to allow the content to naturally flow.
        A link back to the homepage will be present at the top of each page and
        I'm not looking to make that more prominent just yet since the homepage
        doesn't serve up much other than directing you to reading the first
        post. It's all a bit rudimentary at the moment, but to be fair there
        isn't much yet to navigate to, so I'll let this one evolve as the site
        does.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I also put a bit more effort into the HTML structure of the pages since
        the first release, including what I believe is the correct usage of
        semantic elements for the content of the page; <C>article</C>,{' '}
        <C>section</C>, etc. &mdash; I even managed to squeeze in what must be
        my first ever use of the <C>time</C> element for the date of each post.

    <Segment heading="Favicon">
      <Paragraph>
        One of the low hanging fruit I wanted to pick up as soon as possible was
        giving my site a favicon to avoid being stuck with the default which
        ships with <C>create-react-app</C>. I genuinely hadn't given any thought
        as to what I'd want my favicon to be, but I had the spontaneous idea of
        seeing if somebody on the internet had developed a tool to create on
        from text. Of course they had - this is the internet!
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The first result in my search led me to{' '}
        <EL href="https://favicon.io/">favicon.io</EL>. It's a pretty
        uncomplicated tool which lets you create a favicon set from image, text
        or emoji. I opted for text just to see what a favicon of my initials
        would look like, and much to my own surprise I was pretty sold on it
        straight away.
      </Paragraph>
      <ImageBlock

        caption="using favicon.io to create a favicon from text"
      />
      <Paragraph>
        I played around with some of the fonts and colours and after kicking the
        font size around a bit I settled on something which took the lettering
        to the edges of the background box, which I though gave it an
        interesting look.
      </Paragraph>{' '}
      <ImageBlock
        src="site-build-002/faviconio2.png"
        caption="playing with the options to get my preferred icon"
      />
      <Paragraph>
        I downloaded that and added it to my site and was happy with the result
        sitting there in my chrome tab, so much so that I decided to see if it
        would hold its own as a bit of a "logo" on my homepage in place of the
        literal <C>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</C> surrounding my domain.
      </Paragraph>
      <ImageBlock
        src="site-build-002/sitelogo.png"
        caption="the homepage title with the favicon as a logo"
      />
      <Paragraph>
        It didn't look quite right. I mean, the logo itself seemed fine and I
        had all but settled on keeping it, but what bothered me was the white
        lettering. It looked good against a white background because it gave the
        illusion of a cut-out from the background box. I wanted to keep that
        aesthetic whatever the background colour, but it seemed that there was
        no way to do that through the favicon generator I was using, since it
        would always render a solid foreground colour against a solid background
        colour.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        My next thought was to try and create a vector-based version of this
        logo, where the lettering was a path cut-out from the background box.
        Again, the internet delivered in the form of an online vector drawing
        package called <EL href="https://vectr.com/">Vectr</EL>, which dutifully
        follows the commandment that all modern web applications can only use
        one vowel. It is a very simple online drawing package, although
        thankfully it came fully loaded with a bunch of Google fonts including
        the one that I had chosen on my favicon generator. I create a square
        with rounded edges and then added the text layer to match my design.
        Then came the sticking point. It didn't seem possible to "subtract" one
        layer from another. Reading their{' '}
        <EL href="https://vectr.com/user-guide/workspace/workspace-tools/#geometry-tools">
          docs
        </EL>
        , it seems that the application does support this feature, but not if
        one of your layers is text. Damn!
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        I was about to go back to square one and look for alternative
        applications hoping that they had the same font which by this point I
        was fully invested in, but just before leaving I caught a glimpse of the
        "path" tool. This would allow me to draw arbitrary shapes which would be
        valid to subtract from the background. I set to work tracing the
        lettering as a new path layer, expecting to find the process a bit too
        difficult to accomplish on my MacBook's trackpad, but to be fair the
        application was really good at snapping to relevant edges and implicit
        guidelines and even gave fine-grain control of curves. Fantastic! I
        traced the lettering as good as I was going to get it in the brief
        window that my youngest was having a nap and subtracted it from the
        background. I was able to export to drawing as an SVG &mdash;
        thankfully! I hadn't checked whether that was something I could do
        without using a paid version of the tool &mdash; and then ran that SVG
        through another favicon generator to generate all of the different
        shapes and sizes expected by the various modern browsers. I then took
        the largest of these and used it as the logo on my homepage, and I was
        pleased that I persevered with it.

      <Paragraph>
        I hinted briefly in my last post that I like good design and I like
        subtle use of animations to bring a bit of life to a page. The more
        observant of you may have noticed that my pages change their background
        colour each time you reload them; I did that as a starting point just
        for a bit of fun, and I think I'm going to stick with it because I quite
        like it &mdash; I think it offers a bit of entropy to what is currently
        an otherwise bog-standard site.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In the first release, the background was a two-tone split along a
        diagonal line, and whilst that didn't look too bad given the minimal
        effort that was put into it, my ambition was for something a bit more
        curved with subtle undulation. Maybe my PlayStation home screen has been
        subliminally influencing me all these years. I've happened across a
        number of articles and Twitter posts discussing how to animate SVGs, all
        the time wishing that <em>I</em> was somebody who got to do cool UI
        stuff like that &mdash; well, I figured that this might be a nice
        opportunity for me to <strong>(a)</strong> turn that frown upside down,
        and <strong>(b)</strong> see if it could work for my background.
