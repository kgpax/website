        I finally got around the getting the background how I wanted it,
        replacing that sharp diagonal line with some oscillating waves at the
        half-way point of the page. I did wonder whether I should make the
        background fixed in view, so that the wave is always visible at the
        midpoint of the viewport, but I decided against it as I think it serves
        as a subliminal indication of progress down the page. Plus it's
        something to look forward to as you scroll down.{' '}

        It wasn't actually anywhere near as laborious to create as I was
        expecting. Of course, I couldn't have done it without my friend Google,
        but it turns out I'm not all that original and that the idea of{' '}
        <EL href="https://www.google.com/search?q=animated+wave+svg">
          animated wave SVGs
        </EL>{' '}
        is pretty popular and therefore pretty easy to learn how to implement
        without having to remaster trigonometric functions and the dark mystic
        arts of the SVG <C>path</C> element.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        First, I just wanted a static curved svg to see how easily I could fudge
        it into the background. For this, I found the beautifully relevant{' '}
        <EL href="https://getwaves.io/">getwaves.io</EL>, which let me generate
        random wave patterns and copy the SVG <C>path</C> element which drew
        them.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        For reference, this is what the SVG code for a wave can look like:
      </Paragraph>
      <CodeBlock
        showLineNumbers={false}
        code={`<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1440 320">
  <path fill="#0099ff" fill-opacity="1" d="M0,96L48,90.7C96,85,192,75,288,101.3C384,128,480,192,576,213.3C672,235,768,213,864,192C960,171,1056,149,1152,138.7C1248,128,1344,128,1392,128L1440,128L1440,320L1392,320C1344,320,1248,320,1152,320C1056,320,960,320,864,320C768,320,672,320,576,320C480,320,384,320,288,320C192,320,96,320,48,320L0,320Z"></path>
</svg>
`}
      />
      <Paragraph>
        Good luck understanding what's going on in that{' '}
        <C>&lt;path d="..." /&gt;</C>. I have a basic working knowledge of SVG
        drawing syntax, but there is no way I was making one of those on my own!
        Once I had generated one that I liked, I was able to save the{' '}
        <C>.svg</C> file and use that as the <C>background-image</C> to my site.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Of course, that looked pants since the wave was only around <C>320px</C>{' '}
        tall and so it just plonked itself there at the top of my background and
        left the remainder of the page blank. What I wanted was the wave to form
        the transition from one background colour to another at the halfway
        point of the page. I could use CSS properties such as{' '}
        <C>background-position</C> and <C>background-size</C> to fine tune the
        placement, whilst the two-tone background could be achieved on a
        different element underneath the SVG background using a linear gradient
        with a sharp 50% horizontal split. However, the next problem was much
        more significant...
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The SVG which I copied from{' '}
        <EL href="https://getwaves.io/">getwaves.io</EL> was a fixed colour, and
        I needed it to match the second colour of my two-tone background to
        blend the transition. Changing SVG colours in CSS is pretty easy using
        the CSS <C>fill</C> property, except you cannot expect it to work when
        the SVG is used as an image, either in an <C>&lt;img&gt;</C> element or
        as a CSS <C>background-image</C> &mdash; it just doesn't seem to be
        possible address the SVG via CSS that way. The only way to allow CSS to
        influence an SVG in my experience is to use an HTML <C>svg</C> element
        instead of an <C>.svg</C> file as an image. I replicated the SVG code as
        a React component and used CSS to set the fill colour dynamically based
        on the random background colours being used.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The problem now was that the wave SVG was an{' '}
        <EL href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements">
          inline-level element
        </EL>
        , and would become a part of the page layout rather than being a part of
        the background. The solution to this was to get &mdash; in my opinion
        &mdash; a bit hacky. I created a new <C>&lt;Background&gt;</C> React
        component which would have two immediate children: the SVG and the
        actual content, and use CSS to layer them on top of another in the right
        places and put the two-tone solid background under the lot; something
        like this:
      </Paragraph>
      <CodeBlock
        showLineNumbers={false}
        code={`const Container = styled.div\`
  position: relative;
  background: linear-gradient(...);
\`;
const Svg = styled.svg\`
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  top: calc(50% - 160px); /* 160px = 1/2 SVG height */
  left: 0;
  z-index: 1;
\`;
const Children = styled.div\`
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
\`
const Background = () => (
    <Container>
      <Svg />
      <Children>{children}</Children>
    </Container>
);`}
      />
      <Paragraph>
        This worked great, although the CSS needed some tweaking from the above
        simplification in order to look correct on various device widths.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Now that I had the curved line I wanted, the next challenge was to
        animate it in a way that made it look like a wave, slowly undulating
        back and forth. I expected this to be a monster of a task, requiring me
        to look at the SVG paths of a number of waves to try to decipher and
        comprehend the immense gibberish which is the SVG <C>path</C>{' '}
        instructions in order to know what parts would change to achieve the
        desired effect. Once again, though,{' '}
        <EL href="https://getwaves.io/">getwaves.io</EL> came to the rescue -
        indirectly this time.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        When you click the "dice" button on this site to generate a new wave,
        the preview transitions from one wave to another. This tipped me off to
        the idea that browsers can perform the transition from one path to
        another in the same way that they can transition, say, position and
        colour. I did a quick Google to see how that was done and{' '}
        <EL href="https://css-tricks.com/animate-svg-path-changes-in-css/">
          I was incredibly surprised at the answer
        </EL>
        . It was ridiculously simple, and completely unexpected.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        It turns out, SVG paths can be described in CSS as well as in HTML. I
        still can't quite believe that this is correct, because on face value it
        doesn't make much sense, but in essence:
      </Paragraph>
      <CodeBlock
        showLineNumbers={false}
        code={`<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path d="M2,2 L8,8" />
</svg>`}
      />
      <Paragraph>...is the same as...</Paragraph>
      <CodeBlock
        showLineNumbers={false}
        code={`<style>
  .drawMeWithCss {
    d: path('M2,2 L8,8');
  }
</style>
<svg viewBox="0 0 10 10">
  <path class="drawMeWithCss" />
</svg>`}
      />
    </Segment>
    <Paragraph>
      Even though I was convinced this was a{' '}
      <EL href="https://theagileadmin.com/2013/09/16/is-it-a-bug-or-a-feature-who-cares/">
        bug feature
      </EL>
      , I wasn't going to complain, because it meant that I had an "in" now to
      animating an SVG path using native CSS animation:
    </Paragraph>
    <CodeBlock
      showLineNumbers={false}
      language="css"
      code={`@keyframes wave {
  0%   { d: path('<start path>'); }
  100% { d: path('<end path>'); }
}
.drawMeWithCss {
  animation: wave 10s infinite alternate;
}`}
    />
    <Paragraph>
      It worked! I was pretty shocked at how straightforward that was, and
      definitely pleased with the result. Now that I had that working, I
      generated a bunch of new wave SVG paths and used those to give more
      animation keyframes to the wave, and to make it animate in a continuous
      forward direction, starting and ending on the same wave rather than
      bouncing back and forth since that looked less natural.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The next thing I thought I could try was to add more <C>&lt;path&gt;</C>{' '}
      elements to the existing SVG and set slightly different opacities to each
      one, giving the visual appearance of waves overlaying each other. By doing
      this and animating them all with slightly different timings, paths and
      keyframe offsets, I was able to achieve what I think looks like a nice
      natural "wave" aesthetic to transition the page background colours.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The finishing touch for this was to acknowledge that not everybody wants
      motion in their site, and so using the relatively modern CSS media feature{' '}
      <C>@media (prefers-reduced-motion)</C> I could set the animation states to
      be paused, thereby leaving a static wave for those with that preference.
