            I'd been toying with the idea of having my own website for a while. I'm pretty sure I made it a new years resolution for 2021, although when the lockdown kicked in and home-schooling (a.k.a parenting-from-work) became a thing, I'd lost any appetite I had for giving myself extra responsibility.

            I wasn't sure what I would put on a site... in fact at the time of writing this I'm still not sure. I'm a bit of an odd person — some would say stop the sentence there — in that I'm confident and have a lot of self-belief whilst simultaneously being quite shy, humble and self-effacing about putting myself or the work I produce out there in such a public space; I'm not entirely sure

              why this is
            </a>
            , but putting this website out there is a way to try and fight those demons. I'd been given suggestions about making a blog, or a portfolio site, or even just having a space to do some side projects and little fun hacks; all of which are good ideas, and all of which might make their way into it at some point.

          <p
            class="sc-fnVZcZ bWseFA"

            I figured that for my opening gambit, I could write about my experience of putting this site together, and share my thought processes and decisions along the way.

            I'm a full stack developer by trade, or at least historically I am. My passion is for front-end development and my current go-to front-end library is

            In the end, I've opted to reduce the number of learning curves and just go the way of using

            . It's a comfort zone and one which allows me to focus on the early build out of the site without getting bamboozled and ultimately disincentivised right at the start. Heck, check out the

             instead of React because I like the idea of compiling away the framework and having plain-ol\` javascript without all of the extra weight; however, my ultimate aim would be to not be so dependant on javascript at all and instead look to have the content as static as possible for better performance and SEO; all things which I have not had much in the way of personal experience in. As such, I'll probably go down the route of static site generators and migrate all of this code over as part of a learning process.

            I'm quite a visually driven person. I like to think I have a good eye for design, but that doesn't necessarily translate to being

            I've opted to start fairly minimalist, whilst putting at least some thought into colour, typography and spacing. I plan to scour the web for inspiration on how I can enhance the aesthetics of this website, and use it as an opportunity to flex some of those UI and UX muscles which have been wasting away for too long.

            Since then, it has just sat there, squatting; I've renewed it twice since then and only remembered I had it when I got the renewal emails. In fact, it's been so long out of my mind that when I deployed the first version of this site,

             and sure enough the process was really streamlined and really quite cool. I loved how once it got your permission to go to town on your repo, it just set everything up for you. I'm familiar with pipelines and whatnot integrating with GitHub, but I was still pleasantly surprised at how hands-off the process was and how when it was completed, it Just Works™. I had to do some Google-Fu to get my Google domain pointing to my Netlify app, but that's mainly because I didn't RTFM and tried to go it alone with my painfully limited DNS knowledge, but in the end - here we are.

            I'm going to try and make this a regular section to my updates, where I list bits I want to go after next. I won't hold myself to getting everything done, but it will serve as an interesting retrospective for my journey.
