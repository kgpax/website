## What year is it?

Well then... seems that some time back in May 2021, I set out to further enhance the development experience of this site by focussing on getting some testing strategies and tools in place, and sharing my journey and my findings.

That didn't happen. <Emoji alt="thumbs down">üëé</Emoji>

Instead, we find ourselves here; over a year later with no further progress made, but with a new promise made to myself to pour some love &mdash; and effort &mdash; back into building out this site.

A lot can happen in 12 months; for instance &mdash; [I've got a new job](https://formidable.com/about/kevin-paxton/), working with the amazing folk at [Formidable](https://formidable.com). It's a fantastic company and moving there honestly ranks as one of the best choices I've made. It has given me the opportunity to focus again on front-end web development, and less on back-end infrastructure, and to work alongside crazily smart people, building interesting new features and learning lots of new things.

Well... they're new to me anyway, which is an ideal segue into what this entry is all about.

## What have I been doing?

There has been no particular reason why I've had such a long absence from updating the site, but I've not had any particular motivation to do so either.

Until now! <Emoji alt="thumbs up">üëç</Emoji>

Recall that I said in my [first post](/blog/site-build-001#picking-the-tech-stack) that I'd considered using this website build as an opportunity to look into NextJS, Gastby or Eleventy... well my first project in my new role has me working on a NextJS application, and now that I've got some real world exposure to it, it really seems wrong **not** to migrate the SPA website to NextJS, with all of its [SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) bells and [SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) whistles.

So, this post is going to cover the journey of migrating a plain ol' React app to NextJS, along with my learnings of NextJS so far.

## Benefits of SSR

I'd heard of Server Side Rendering before, but had never actually utilised it anywhere. I knew of its main benefits being less javascript (and subsequently labour) shipped to the browser, and having the page content present in the response from the server which helps to get those SEO brownie-points.

However, I've never really considered some of the more general benefits you get from SSR....

## SSR or SSG?
